## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

"I am not a developer."

I enjoy being an engineer and building solutions/tools as a hobby, not a full-time job.

Expect a wide-range of projects associated with my account (i.e., Websites, Desktop Applications, Data Science Projects, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain Coding Projects, and Analytical/Business Intelligence Reporting Tools).
